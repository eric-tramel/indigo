This is just a test post to see if I have everything configured correctly.
For example, if I want to say something about some Julia code, in 
`Markdown` I would say something like


```c
    unsigned int fenced = code_block();
```

```julia
    using Distributions

    function a_test_func!(a::Array{Float64})
        a .+= a
    end

    opt = Dict()
    opt[:keyword] = 1
    opt[:another] = 2
```

```c
    #include <iostream>
    using namespaces std;

    int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
        cout<<"Hello World!"<<endl;
        return 0;
    }
```

Or, if I were using MathJax I would say something like 

$$\rho = \frac{1}{x},$$

and if I wanted it inline I'd have to say \\(\rho - \frac{1}{x} \\) or 
something like that.
