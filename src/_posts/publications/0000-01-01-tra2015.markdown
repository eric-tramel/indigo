    Discrete tomography, or the reconstruction of binary images from a set of limited angular
    measurements, has applications within many practical and theoretical fields. The binary
    limitation on pixel values should allow for exact reconstruction from very few measurements,
    however, developing algorithms to deliver on this theoretical promise is challenging. The field
    of statistical physics has long been interested in the properties of correlated binary models, e.g. the
    well-known Ising model, which can be used to capture the intricacies of local correlations within
    an image. Using these well-known models and approaches can deliver accurate and efficient 
    tomographic reconstruction without yielding to greedy or convex-ified algorithms by instead 
    operating on a grounded statistical interpretation of the problem via the factorized estimation of the 
    a posteriori probability of pixel values.

    In this talk we will discuss recently published work in applying Belief Propagation (BP) to estimate 
    this factorization, its exact nature in 1D line reconstruction, its advantages over convex techniques such
    as Total Variation (TV), and the challenges in its application to 2D image models. Next, 
    we will discuss new results which improve on the BP approach both in terms of computational
    efficiency and accuracy by moving to a 2D model and applying a mean-field approximation with 2nd order
    corrections (Ã  la Thouless-Anderson-Palmer). Finally, we will discuss some future promising work in
    the application of these techniques to multi-color discrete tomography problems via the Potts model and
    its applications to angle-limited electron tomography.
