## Invited Panelist

I was an invited panelist for this webinar put on by Cloudera's Fast Forward Labs,
alongside Virginia Smith (CMU), and Andrew Trask (OpenMined, Deepmind, Oxford).
I talked a bit about the specific challenges involved in the application of 
federated learning in the health industry.
